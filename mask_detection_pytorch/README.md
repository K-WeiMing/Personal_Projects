# Aims of this mini-project:

1. To be able to apply transfer learning using Computer Vision on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.

   - Aim to familiarize the building of a PyTorch Model using FasterRCNN (pre-trained)
   - Aim to successfully fine-tune the model
   - Aim to successfully load the saved model and perform inference

2. To be able to deploy the trained model using Docker/FastAPI
   - Aim to be familiar with using Docker and FastAPI
   - Deployment using both these tools for inference
